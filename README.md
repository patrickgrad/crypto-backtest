Types of graphs this code can generate:

1. Shaded cumulative volume distribution of single snapshot with total bid and total ask volume annotation

2. Line plot of account values or % return of two different strageties with certain statistics overlaid.


Coming soon:

1. Candlestick of order book, sections weighted by volume with median price line overlaid

2. Line plot using average of top-of-the-book prices

3. Line plot of % returns of two different strageties represented by red and blue

4. Parameter variation: simulate strategy varying a constant parameter to define working range/robustness.
