Types of graphs this utility can generate:

-1. Shaded cumulative volume distribution of single snapshot with total bid and total ask volume annotation
2. Candlestick of order book, sections weighted by volume with median price line overlaid
4. Line plot using average of top-of-the-book prices
-5. Line plot of % returns of two different strageties represented by red and blue
6. Parameter variation: simulate strategy varying a constant parameter to define working range/robustness
